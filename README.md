# Quaerite Regnum Dei

_Quaerite Regnum Dei_, Latin for &laquo;Seek ye the Kingdom of God&raquo;, is a libre open source font. Quaerite Regnum Dei is based on a beautiful Spanish _rotunda_ hand found in the Misal rico de Cisneros. In the early 16th century, Francisco Jim√©nez de Cisneros, who was a cardinal in Spain, commissioned local monks/scribes to create a missal to be used in his Toledo cathedral.

[The result](http://bdh.bne.es/bnesearch/detalle/bdh0000012826) is held by the Spanish National Library, who graciously created high resolution scans of it available to the whole world. I used their scans to make this font.

As this font is meant to look like handwriting, I decided that it was improper to make just one of each letter. So, the font contains two of each lowercase letter; some, such as &lsaquo;s&rsaquo;, have 5 alternates. 

This font is almost done, but like all open source projects, you can help, and there are still things to do.

* The missal contains many combining marks; I have yet to implement any of them.
* Some glyphs in the missal might be missing. I did not look at every page. If you find a missing glyph, symbol or ligature _in the big rotunda hand_, please open a bug report. If you find a missing interesting alternate, do so as well please.
* Some kerns need to be added or improved. If you find a particularly bad kern, open a bug report. Please note what value you think it should be, or open a PR against features.fea to add it.
